# better-sqlite3

*You want [Node](http://nodejs.org/)?*

*You want [Sqlite](http://sqlite.org/)?*

*You want your life to be* **easy?**

##### **Well you're in luck because better-sqlite3 is here!!!!**

- Full transaction support
- Full atomicity on a single connection
- Geared for performance and efficiency
- Easy-to-use node-style API

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save better-sqlite3
```

## Usage

```js
var Database = require('better-sqlite3');
var db = new Database('foobar.db', options);

db.on('open', function () {
	db.statement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?").get(userId, function (err, row) {
		console.log(row.firstName, row.lastName, row.email);
	});
})
```

## Why should I use this instead of [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)?

- `node-sqlite3` uses asynchronous APIs for tasks that don't touch the hard disk. That's not only bad besign, but it wastes tons of resources.
- `node-sqlite3` forces you to manage the memory of SQLite3 statements yourself. `better-sqlite3` does it the JavaScript way, allowing the garbage collector to worry about memory management.
- `better-sqlite3` splits your database connectino into two parts; a read-only connection, and a writable connection. This gives you completely atomic transactions and protects you from reading uncommitted data.

# API

## new Database(*path*, [*options*])

This opens a new database connection. If the specified database does not exist, it is created.

When the database is ready for use, the `open` event is emitted.

If the database is closed, the `close` event will be emitted. If the database was closed because of an error, the associated `Error` object will be available as the first argument of the `close` event. If there was no error, the first argument will be `null`.

### Options

#### *options.memory*

If this option is `true`, an in-memory database will be created, rather than a disk-bound one. Default is `false`.

#### *options.wal*

By default, databases are be opened in [Write Ahead Logging](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) mode. If you set this option to `false`, the old [Rollback Journal](https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback) mode will be used.

### .statement(sqlString) -> Statement

Creates a new prepared `Statement` object. This method will throw an exception if the provided string is not a valid SQL statement.

### .transaction(arrayOfStrings) -> Transaction

Creates a new prepared `Transaction` object. Each string in the given array must be a valid SQL statement. Transactions cannot contain read-only statements. In `better-sqlite3`, transactions serve the sole purpose of batch-write operations. For read-only operations, use regular [prepared statements](#).
