# better-sqlite3 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3)

The fastest and simplest library for SQLite3 in Node.js.

- Full transaction support
- Geared for performance and efficiency
- Easy-to-use synchronous API *(faster than an asynchronous API... yes, you read that correctly)*

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save better-sqlite3
```

## Usage

```js
var Database = require('better-sqlite3');
var db = new Database('foobar.db', options);

db.on('open', function () {
	var row = db.statement('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?').get(userId);
	console.log(row.firstName, row.lastName, row.email);
});
```

## Why should I use this instead of [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)?

- `node-sqlite3` uses asynchronous APIs for tasks that don't involve I/O. That's not only bad besign, but it wastes tons of resources.
- `node-sqlite3` exposes low-level (C language) memory management functions. `better-sqlite3` does it the JavaScript way, allowing the garbage collector to worry about memory management.
- `better-sqlite3` is much faster than `node-sqlite3` in most cases, and just as fast in all other cases.

# API

## new Database(*path*, [*options*])

Creates a new database connection. If the database file does not exist, it is created.

When the database connection is ready, the `open` event is fired.

If the database is closed, the `close` event will be fired. If an error occured while trying to open or close the database, the associated `Error` object will be available as the first parameter of the `close` event. If there was no error, the first parameter will be `null`.

If `options.memory` is `true`, an in-memory database will be created, rather than a disk-bound one. Default is `false`.

### .statement(*string*) -> *Statement*

Creates a new prepared [`Statement`](#class-statement) from the given SQL string.

### .transaction(*arrayOfStrings*) -> *Transaction*

Creates a new prepared [`Transaction`](#class-transaction) from the given array of SQL strings.

*NOTE:* [`Transaction`](#class-transaction) objects cannot contain read-only statements. In `better-sqlite3`, transactions serve the sole purpose of batch-write operations. For read-only operations, use regular [prepared statements](#statementstring---statement). This restriction may change in the future.

### .pragma(*string*, [*simplify*]) -> *results*

Executes the given PRAGMA and return its result. By default, the return value will be an array of result rows. Each row is represented by an object whose keys correspond to column names.

Since most PRAGMA statements return a single value, the `simplify` option is provided to make things easier. With this option, only the first column of the first row will be returned.

```js
db.pragma('cache_size = 32000');
var cacheSize = db.pragma('cache_size', true); // returns the string "32000"
```

The data returned by `.pragma()` is always in string format. If execution of the PRAGMA fails, an `Error` is thrown.

It's better to use this method instead of normal [prepared statements](#statementstring---statement) when executing PRAGMA, because this method normalizes some odd behavior that may otherwise be experienced. The documentation on SQLite3 PRAGMA can be found [here](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html).

### .checkpoint([*force*]) -> *number*

Runs a [WAL mode checkpoint](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html).

By default, this method will execute a checkpoint in "PASSIVE" mode, which means it might not perform a *complete* checkpoint if there are pending reads or write on the database. If the first argument is `true`, it will execute the checkpoint in "RESTART" mode, which ensures a complete checkpoint operation.

When the operation is complete, it returns a number between `0` and `1`, indicating the fraction of the WAL file that was checkpointed. For forceful checkpoints ("RESTART" mode), this number will always be `1` unless there was no WAL file to begin with.

If execution of the checkpoint fails, an `Error` is thrown.

### .close() -> *this*

Closes the database connection. After invoking this method, no statements/transactions can be created or executed. When all resources have been released, the `close` event will be fired.

### *get* .open -> *boolean*

Returns whether the database is currently open.

### *get* .name -> *string*

Returns the string that was used to open the databse connection.

## class *Statement*

An object representing a single SQL statement.

### .run([*...bindParameters*]) -> *object*

**(only on write statements)*

Executes the prepared statement. When execution completes it returns an `info` object describing any changes made. The `info` object has two properties:

- `info.changes`: The total number of rows that were inserted, updated, or deleted by this operation. Changes made by [foreign key actions](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions) or [trigger programs](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html) do not count.
- `info.lastInsertROWID`: The [rowid](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid) of the last row inserted into the database. If the current statement did not insert any rows into the database, this number should be completely ignored.

If execution of the statement fails, an `Error` is thrown.

You can specify [bind parameters](#binding-parameters), which are only bound for the given execution.

### .get([*...bindParameters*]) -> *row*

**(only on read-only statements)*

Executes the prepared statement. When execution completes it returns an object that represents the first row retrieved by the query. The object's keys represent column names.

If the statement was successful but found no data, `undefined` is returned. If execution of the statement fails, an `Error` is thrown.

You can specify [bind parameters](#binding-parameters), which are only bound for the given execution.

### .all([*...bindParameters*]) -> *array of rows*

**(only on read-only statements)*

Similar to [`.get()`](#getbindparameters---row), but instead of only retrieving one row all matching rows will be retrieved. The return value is an array of row objects.

If no rows are found, the array will be empty. If execution of the statement fails, an `Error` is thrown.

You can specify [bind parameters](#binding-parameters), which are only bound for the given execution.

### .each([*...bindParameters*], callback) -> *undefined*

**(only on read-only statements)*

Similar to [`.all()`](#allbindparameters---array-of-rows), but instead of returning every row together, the `callback` is invoked for each row as they are retrieved, one by one.

After all rows have been consumed, `undefined` is returned. If execution of the statement fails, an `Error` is thrown and iteration stops.

You can specify [bind parameters](#binding-parameters), which are only bound for the given execution.

### .pluck() -> *this*

**(only on read-only statements)*

Causes the prepared statement to only return the value of the first column of any rows that it retrieves, rather than the entire row object.

This method can only be invoked before the statement is first executed. After a statement invokes this method, it cannot be undone.

### .bind([*...bindParameters*]) -> *this*

[Binds the given parameters](#binding-parameters) to the statement *permanently*. Unlike binding parameters upon execution, these parameters will stay bound to the prepared statement for its entire life.

This method can only be invoked before the statement is first executed. After a statement's parameters are bound this way, you may no longer provide it with execution-specific (temporary) bound parameters.

This method is primarily used as a performance optimization when you need to execute the same prepared statement many times with the same bound parameters. However, if the prepared statement will only be executed once, it's faster to bind the parameters directly with the execution ([`run()`](#runbindparameters---object), [`get()`](#getbindparameters---row), [`all()`](#allbindparameters---array-of-rows), or [`each()`](#eachbindparameters-callback---undefined)).

### *get* .source -> *string*

Returns the source string that was used to create the prepared statement.

### *get* .readonly -> *boolean*

Returns whether the prepared statement is read-only.

## class *Transaction*

An object representing many SQL statements grouped into a single logical [transaction](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html).

### .run([*...bindParameters*]) -> *object*

Similar to [`Statement#run()`](#runbindparameters---object).

Each statement in the transaction is executed in order. Failed transactions are automatically rolled back.

When execution completes it returns an `info` object describing any changes made. The `info` object has two properties:

- `info.changes`: The total number of rows that were inserted, updated, or deleted by this transaction. Changes made by [foreign key actions](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions) or [trigger programs](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html) do not count.
- `info.lastInsertROWID`: The [rowid](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid) of the last row inserted into the database. If the current transaction did not insert any rows into the database, this number should be completely ignored.

If execution of the transaction fails, an `Error` is thrown.

You can specify [bind parameters](#binding-parameters), which are only bound for the given execution.

### .bind([*...bindParameters*]) -> *this*

Same as [`Statement#bind()`](#bindbindparameters---this).

### *get* .source -> *string*

Returns a concatenation of every source string that was used to create the prepared transaction. The source strings are seperated by newline characters (`\n`).


# Binding Parameters

This section refers to anywhere in the documentation that specifies the optional argument [*`...bindParameters`*].

There are many ways to bind parameters to a prepared statement or transaction. The simplest way is with anonymous parameters:

```js
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES (?, ?, ?)');

// The following are equivalent.
stmt.run('John', 'Smith', 45);
stmt.run(['John', 'Smith', 45]);
stmt.run(['John'], ['Smith', 45]);
```

You can also use named parameters. SQLite3 provides [4 different syntaxes for named parameters](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html), **three** of which are supported by `better-sqlite3` (`@foo`, `:foo`, and `$foo`). However, if you use named parameters, make sure to only use **one** syntax within a given [`Statement`](#class-statement) or [`Transaction`](#class-transaction) object. Mixing syntaxes within the same object is not supported.

```js
// The following are equivalent.
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES (@firstName, @lastName, @age)');
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES (:firstName, :lastName, :age)');
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES ($firstName, $lastName, $age)');

stmt.run({
	firstName: 'John',
	lastName: 'Smith',
	age: 45
});
```

Below is an example of mixing anonymous parameters with named parameters.

```js
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES (@name, @name, ?)');
stmt.run(45, {name: 'Henry'});
```

# Performance

Concurrently reading and writing from an SQLite3 database can be very slow in some cases. Since concurrency is usually very important in web applications, it's recommended to turn on [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) to greatly increase overall performance and concurrency.

```js
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
```

WAL mode has a *few* disadvantages to consider:
- Transactions that involve ATTACHed databases are atomic for each individual database, but are not atomic across all databases as a set.
- Under rare circumstances, the [WAL file](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) may experience "checkpoint starvation" (see below).
- There are some hardware/system limitations that may affect some users, [listed here](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html).

However, you trade those disadvantages for greatly improved performance in most web applications.

If you want to *further* improve write performance and you're willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of [durability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)), you can use this:

```js
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
db.pragma('synchronous = 1');
```

Normally, setting `synchronous = 1` would introduce the risk of database corruption following a power loss or hard reboot. But in [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html), you do not introduce this risk. The combination of these two PRAGMAs provides extremely fast performance.

### Checkpoint starvation

Checkpoint starvation is when SQLite3 is unable to recycle the [WAL file](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) due to everlasting concurrent reads to the database. If this happens, the WAL file will grow without bound, leading to unacceptable amounts of disk usage and deteriorating performance.

To prevent this, you can use the [db.checkpoint()](#checkpointforce---number) method to force checkpointing whenever you deem appropriate.

# 64-bit integer support

SQLite3 can store data in 64-bit signed integers, which are too big for JavaScript's [number format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point) to fully represent. To support this data type, `better-sqlite3` provides the immutable `Int64` class:

```js
var Int64 = require('better-sqlite3').Int64;

var number = new Int64(0x1234abcd, 0x00005678);
number.toString(); // returns "95073701505997"
+number;           // returns 95073701505997

var bigNumber = new Int64(0x01234abcd, 0x0fff5678);
bigNumber.toString(); // returns "1152735103331642317"
+bigNumber;           // returns NaN, cannot be represented in JavaScript

number.equals(bigNumber); // returns false
number.equals(+number); // returns true
```

An `Int64` is constructed of two parts: its lower 32 bits, and its higher 32 bits, respectively. The higher bits are optional, and default to `0`.

You can convert any `Int64` to a string to see its full value. If you try to convert an `Int64` to a JavaScript number, it will convert to `NaN` if the number is too big to be accurately represented.

### Binding Int64s

`Int64s` can be bound to [`Statements`](#class-statement) and [`Transactions`](#class-transaction) just like normal numbers.

```js
db.statement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?").get(new Int64(0x01234abcd, 0x0fff5678));
db.statement("INSERT INTO big_numbers VALUES (?)").run(new Int64(0x01234abcd, 0x0fff5678));
```

### Getting Int64s from the database

By default, integers returned from the database are normal JavaScript numbers (this includes the `info.lastInsertROWID` property returned by the [`run()`](#runbindparameters---object) methods). If these numbers get too high (larger than 9007199254740991), their values will be incorrect, potentially causing very bad errors. You can change this default by invoking `db.defaultSafeIntegers(true)`.

Additionally, you can override the default for individual [`statements`](#class-statement) and [`transactions`](#class-transaction) like so:

```js
db.statement(SQL).safeIntegers(); // Safe integers ON
db.statement(SQL).safeIntegers(true); // Safe integers ON
db.statement(SQL).safeIntegers(false); // Safe integers OFF

// You can do the same thing with Transaction objects.
```

### Extending Int64s

`Int64` objects are very basic and do not provide advanced functionality. However, they expose accessors for their `low` and `high` bits, which matches the API for the very comprehensive [Long](https://github.com/dcodeIO/long.js) library. If you need to manipulate 64 bit integers, the strategy is quite simple:

```js
var Int64 = require('better-sqlite3').Int64;
Object.assign(Int64.prototype, require('long').prototype);

var int64 = statement.safeIntegers().pluck().get();
int64 = int64.multiply(2); // You can use methods from the Long library now
```
