# better-sqlite3

The fastest and most carefully designed library for SQLite3 in Node.js.

- Full transaction support
- Full atomicity on a single connection
- Geared for performance and efficiency
- Easy-to-use node-style API

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save better-sqlite3
```

## Usage

```js
var Database = require('better-sqlite3');
var db = new Database('foobar.db', options);

db.on('open', function () {
	db.statement('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?').get(userId, function (err, row) {
		console.log(row.firstName, row.lastName, row.email);
	});
})
```

## Why should I use this instead of [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)?

- `node-sqlite3` uses asynchronous APIs for tasks that don't touch the hard disk. That's not only bad besign, but it wastes tons of resources.
- `node-sqlite3` forces you to manage the memory of SQLite3 statements yourself. `better-sqlite3` does it the JavaScript way, allowing the garbage collector to worry about memory management.
- This module secretly splits your database connectino into two parts; a read-only connection, and a writable connection, which gives you completely atomic transactions and protects you from reading uncommitted data.

# API

## new Database(*path*, [*options*])

This creates a database connection. If the database file does not exist, it is created.

When the database connection is ready, the `open` event is fired.

If the database is closed, the `close` event will be fired. If the database was closed because of an error, the associated `Error` object will be available as the first argument of the `close` event. If there was no error, the first argument will be `null`.

### Options

#### *options.memory*

If this option is `true`, an in-memory database will be created, rather than a disk-bound one. Default is `false`.

#### *options.wal*

If this option is `true` (the default), the following PRAGMA are applied:
- `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;`
- `PRAGMA synchronous = 1;`

This means the database will be opened in [Write Ahead Logging](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) mode. If you set `options.wal` to `false`, the old [Rollback Journal](https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback) mode will be used, as well as the default `synchronous` setting.

### .statement(sqlString) -> Statement

Creates a new prepared [`Statement`](#class-statement) object. This method will throw an exception if the provided string is not a valid SQL statement.

### .transaction(arrayOfStrings) -> Transaction

Creates a new prepared [`Transaction`](#class-transaction) object. Each string in the given array must be a valid SQL statement. [`Transaction`](#class-transaction) objects cannot contain read-only statements. In `better-sqlite3`, transactions serve the sole purpose of batch-write operations. For read-only operations, use regular [prepared statements](#statementsqlstring---statement).

### .pragma(sqlString, [simplify]) -> results

This method will execute the given PRAGMA statement **synchronously** and return its result. By default, the return value will be an array of result rows. Each row is represented by an object whose keys correspond to column names.

Since most PRAGMA statements return a single value, the `simplify` option is provided to make things easier. With this option, only the first column of the first row will be returned.

```js
db.pragma('cache_size = 32000');
var cacheSize = db.pragma('cache_size', true); // returns the string "32000"
```

The data returned by `.pragma()` is always in string format. The documentation on SQLite3 PRAGMA statements can be found [here](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html).

#### WARNING: You should NOT use prepared [statements](#statementsqlstring---statement) or [transactions](#transactionarrayofstrings---transaction) to run PRAGMA statements. Doing so could result in database corruption.

### .close() -> this

Closes the database connection. After invoking this method, no statements/transactions can be created or executed. The underlying connection will wait for any outstanding queries to complete before gracefully closing the connection. When all outstanding queries have completed, the `close` event will be fired.

### *get* .open -> boolean

Returns whether the database is currently open.

## class *Statement*

An object representing a single SQL statement.

### .run([...bindParameters], callback) -> this

*[UNAVAILABLE ON READ-ONLY STATEMENTS]*

Executes the statement asynchronously. When the operation completes the callback will be invoked. If the operation fails, the first argument of the callback will be an `Error`, otherwise `null`.

Upon success, the second callback argument will be an `info` object describing any changes made. The `info` object has two properties:

- `info.changes`: The total number of rows that were inserted, updated, or deleted by this operation. Changes made by [foreign key actions](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions) or [trigger programs](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html) do not count.
- `info.lastInsertROWID`: The [rowid](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid) of the [last row inserted into the database](https://www.sqlite.org/capi3ref.html#sqlite3_last_insert_rowid). If the current statement did not insert any rows into the database, this number should be completely ignored.

### .get([...bindParameters], callback) -> this

*[ONLY ON READ-ONLY STATEMENTS]*

Executes the statement asynchronously. When the operation completes the callback will be invoked. If the operation fails, the first argument of the callback will be an `Error`, otherwise `null`.

Upon success, the second callback argument will be an object representing the *first row* retrieved by the query. If the statement was successful but retrieved no data, the second argument will be `undefined`.

### .all([...bindParameters], callback) -> this

*[ONLY ON READ-ONLY STATEMENTS]*

Similar to [`.get()`](#getbindparameters-callback---this), but instead of only retrieving one row, all matching rows will be retrieved. The second argument of the callback will be an array of objects that each represent a row. If no rows are retrieved, the array will be empty.

### .each([...bindParameters], rowCallback, finalCallback) -> this

*[ONLY ON READ-ONLY STATEMENTS]*

Similar to [`.all()`](#allbindparameters-callback---this), but instead of returning every row together, `rowCallback` will be invoked for each row as they are retrieved. After all rows have been consumed, `finalCallback` is invoked to indicate completion.

If execution of the statement fails, `finalCallback` will be invoked with an `Error` object as its first argument, and iteration will stop.

### .pluck() -> this

*[ONLY ON READ-ONLY STATEMENTS]*

Causes the prepared statement to only return the value of the first column of any rows that it retrieves, rather than the entire row object.

This method can only be invoked before the statement is first executed. After a statement invokes this method, it cannot be undone.

### .bind([...bindParameters]) -> this

Binds the given parameters to the statement *permanently*. Unlike binding parameters upon execution, these parameters will stay bound to the prepared statement for its entire life.

This method can only be invoked before the statement is first executed. After a statement's parameters are bound this way, you may no longer provide it with execution-specific (temporary) bound parameters.

This method is primarily used as a performance enhancement for executing the same statement many times with same parameters.

### *get* .busy -> boolean

Returns whether the prepared statement is mid-execution. If a statement is busy, it cannot be executed again until its query completes.

## class *Transaction*

An object representing many SQL statements grouped into a single logical [transaction](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html).

### .run([...bindParameters], callback) -> this

Similar to [`Statement#run()`](#runbindparameters-callback---this).

Each statement in the transaction is executed in order. Failed transactions are automatically rolled back.

Upon success, the second callback argument will be an `info` object describing any changes made. The `info` object has two properties:

- `info.changes`: The total number of rows that were inserted, updated, or deleted by this transaction. Changes made by [foreign key actions](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions) or [trigger programs](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html) do not count.
- `info.lastInsertROWID`: The [rowid](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid) of the [last row inserted into the database](https://www.sqlite.org/capi3ref.html#sqlite3_last_insert_rowid). If the current transaction did not insert any rows into the database, this number should be completely ignored.

### .bind([...bindParameters]) -> this

Same as [`Statement#bind()`](#bindbindparameters---this).

### *get* .busy -> boolean

Same as [`Statement#busy`](#get-busy---boolean).

# Binding Parameters

This section applies to anywhere in the documentation that specifies the optional argument `[...bindParameters]`.

There are many ways to bind parameters to a prepared statement or transaction. The simplest way is with anonymous parameters:

```js
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES (?, ?, ?)');

// The following are equivalent.
stmt.run('John', 'Smith', 45, callback);
stmt.run(['John', 'Smith', 45], callback);
stmt.run(['John'], ['Smith', 45], callback);
```

You can also use named parameters. SQLite3 provides [4 different syntaxes for named parameters](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html), three of which are supported by `node-sqlite3` (`:foo`, `@foo`, and `$foo`). However, if you use named parameters, make sure to only use **one** syntax within a given [`Statement`](#class-statement) or [`Transaction`](#class-transaction) object. Mixing syntaxes within the same object is not supported. When using named parameters, all named paramaters must be in a single object. You cannot split them across several objects.

```js
// The following are equivalent.
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES (@firstName, @lastName, @age)');
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES (:firstName, :lastName, :age)');
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES ($firstName, $lastName, $age)');

stmt.run({
	firstName: 'John',
	lastName: 'Smith',
	age: 45
}, callback);
```

Below is an example of mixing anonymous parameters with named parameters.

```js
var stmt = db.statement('INSERT INTO people VALUES (@name, @name, ?)');
stmt.run(45, {name: 'Henry'}, callback);
```
