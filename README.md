# better-sqlite3 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3)

The fastest and simplest library for SQLite3 in Node.js.

- Full transaction support
- Geared for performance and efficiency
- Easy-to-use synchronous API *(faster than an asynchronous API... yes, you read that correctly)*
- 64-bit integer support *(invisible until you need it)*

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save better-sqlite3
```

## Usage

```js
var Database = require('better-sqlite3');
var db = new Database('foobar.db', options);

db.on('open', function () {
	var row = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?').get(userId);
	console.log(row.firstName, row.lastName, row.email);
});
```

## Why should I use this instead of [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)?

- `node-sqlite3` uses asynchronous APIs for tasks that don't wait for I/O. That's not only bad design, but it wastes tons of resources.
- `node-sqlite3` exposes low-level (C language) memory management functions. `better-sqlite3` does it the JavaScript way, allowing the garbage collector to worry about memory management.
- `better-sqlite3` is simpler to use, and it provides nice utilities for some operations that are very difficult or impossible in `node-sqlite3`.
- `better-sqlite3` is much faster than `node-sqlite3` in most cases, and just as fast in all other cases.
