---------- Version 1 ----------
add "real-world" read+write benchmark
figure out why node-sqlite3's select-all.sync.small.js is unrealistically fast

write tests

compare tests to node-sqlite3

rewrite .travis.yml (node 4+)

---------- Version 2 ----------
use special objects to deal with 64bit integers

---------- Backlog ----------
Make sure that Promise.promisify(fn, {deoptimize: true}) does not reduce performance too much for situations with ~6 arguments
